ECE1508 Problem Set #4
April 10 2015
James Bailey

This readme file describes the deliverables for problem set 4.

I have written this assigmnent in Python, but have used the previous assignments
simulator/decoder that was written in C++.

Software requirements:
    * g++ with support for C++/11 (or some other C++/11 compiler)
    * Make
    * Python 2.7.x
    * scipy Python package (www.scipy.org)
    * numpy Python package (should be included in scipy)
    * matplotlib Python package (should be included in scipy)
    * pulp Python package (pypi.python.org/pypi/PuLP)

results/*.data
        This contains the logged data results from each question.  I used this data
        in my plotter scripts.

lt_plot.py:
        Python script to plot results. This is for the LT code question. 

lp_plot.py:
        Python script to plot results. This is for the LP decoder question.

raptor_plot.py:
        Python script to plot results. This is for the raptor code question.

lt.py:
        This is the LT code decoder program.
lp.py:
        This is the LP decoder program.

raptor.py:
        This is the LT portion of the raptor code program.

Makefile:
        Used to compile the C++ code for the SPA simulator.  This is taken from ps2.
        Usage: make

spa.cc:
        C++ script that implements the decoder and simulation.  This is taken from ps2.
        This is used in the raptor code question for the precoder.
        Compiles with make flow to produce 'spa' binary.

spa:
        Compiled version of the assignment.  I have provided the latest compiled version
        from my development, although it will only work on similar architectures (x86-64, Linux)
        Usage: ./spa < code.txt

plots/*.pdf:
        Plots for each question are here.  They are what is in the printed assignment.
