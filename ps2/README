ECE1508 Problem Set #2
March 7 2015
James Bailey

This readme file describes the deliverables for problem 2.8.

I have written this assigmnent primarily in C++.  Initially I tried adapting my Python
scripts from the previous assignment, but they were way too slow.

Software requirements:
    * g++ with support for C++/11 (or some other C++/11 compiler)
    * Make
    * Python 2.7.x
    * scipy Python package (www.scipy.org)
    * numpy Python package (should be included in scipy)
    * matplotlib Python package (should be included in scipy)

Makefile:
        Used to compile the C++ code for the assignment.  
        Usage: make

spa.cc:
        C++ script that implements the decoder and simulation portion of the assignment.
        Compiles with make flow to produce 'spa' binary.

spa:
        Compiled version of the assignment.  I have provided the latest compiled version
        from my development, although it will only work on similar architectures (x86-64, Linux)
        Usage: ./spa < code.txt

parity_gen.py:
        This script generates a random LDPC(1200,x2,x5) parity table in the same format
        described in the assignment.  I used this to generate all my codes.
        Usage: ./parity_gen.py

codes/*.txt:
        These are my generated codes.

codes/*.data:
        This is the generated simulation data from my codes.  The first row specifies the
        erasure probability.  The subsequent rows are formatted: it_count, ber1, ber2, ber3, ...

plotResults.py:
        Python script to plot results.  This loads the *.data files and plots the contents.
        Only one plot displays at a time.  When you close one, the next will open up.
        Usage: ./plotResults.py

plot_a.png:
        This is a plot of each 10 codes and their average.

plot_b.png:
        This is a plot of the 10 code average and the provided code performance.

plot_c.png:
        This is a plot of the provided code performance at a variety of iteration limits.
