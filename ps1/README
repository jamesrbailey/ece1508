ECE1508 Problem Set #1
January 16 2015

This readme file describes the deliverables for problem 1.8.

For each channel/decoder pairing 200 simulations were run.  In practise I ran a lot more while
developing the script and the results are consistent, although I have not proven the confidence.

Software requirements:
    * Python 2.7.x
    * scipy Python package (www.scipy.org)
    * numpy Python package (should be included in scipy)
    * matplotlib Python package (should be included in scipy)

spa.py:
        Python script to simulate SPA algorithm over BSC, BEC, AWGN channels.  Saves results to *_spa.data files.
        Usage: ./spa.py

exhaustive.py:
        Python script to simulate exhaustive word ML algorithm over BSC, BEC, AWGN channels.  Saves results to *_ex.data files.
        Usage: ./exhaustive.py

plotResults.py:
        Python script to plot results.  This loads the *.data files and plots the contents.
        Only one plot displays at a time.  When you close one, the next will open up.
        Usage: ./plotResults.py

<bsc|bec|awgn>_<ex|spa>.data:
        Data files containing the results of the previous run of the spa.py and/or exhaustive.py scripts.
        Format is csv WER values on first line, and then channel parameter on second line.
        I have provided the results of my own run - these should be reproducable simply by running the above scripts.

bsc_plot.png:
        Plot of results for BSC simulations.  This can be reproduced by running the plotResults.py script.

bec_plot.png:
        Plot of results for BEC simulations.  This can be reproduced by running the plotResults.py script.

awgn_plot.png:
        Plot of results for AWGN simulations.  This can be reproduced by running the plotResults.py script.
